Users</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The following is a real image which is being retrieved from an
external server:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://troll.xsfs.xyz/troll.png" alt="Troll Image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Troll Image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Don’t believe that this is your real IP address? <a
href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/"
class="uri">https://whatismyipaddress.com/</a><br />
Of course, if you’re using a VPN, this won’t be your IP address but an
IP address belonging to the VPN</p>
<p>But when we send this image into a Discord server, we get this:<br />
<img src="https://xsfs.xyz/assets/img/2023/discord-bait.png"
alt="Discord Image" /></p>
<h2 id="how-does-this-work">How does this work?</h2>
<p>Well, you can read the code <a
href="https://github.com/the-wright-jamie/Image-Troll-Server">here</a>
and see for yourself, but the code doesn’t reveal the full story - so
keep reading to learn more about this.</p>
<p>Basically web servers don’t have to serve static images, as long as
they return the data with a specified MIME type the browser (or
application, i.e. in this case Discord) will be able to render whatever
it was that was sent to it. That means we can use simple web server
frameworks, like NodeJS + Express, to interpret a request; modify an
image; and then return the data the client is expecting.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-intended-path-for-the-victim">What is the intended
path for the victim?</h2>
<p>Due to the way Discord works, we need to present some bait to the
user to get them to click “Open in browser” which will then display
their IP address to them.</p>
<p>So basically <code>User sees (bait) image</code> ➜
<code>User clicks Open In Browser</code> ➜
<code>User gets pranked</code></p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-to-use-bait">Why do we need to use bait?</h2>
<p>You may be thinking the reason we need to use bait is to get around
moderators in servers immediately deleting the images, but actually,
it’s a little more complicated than that. TL;DR, Discord presents a
cached version of the image to the user.</p>
<p>The long answer: to understand why we need bait, we need to
understand how Discord handles images. Here is the basic process for how
an image is displayed to a user in Discord:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A user sends the link to the image</li>
<li>A Discord crawler crawls the link to see what it is
(<code>crawl-{crawler-ip-address}.ptr.discord.com</code>)</li>
<li>The crawler sees that it’s an image, and hands it off to the caching
server
(<code>{undetermined-ip-address}.bc.googleusercontent.com</code>)</li>
<li>The caching server reads the image</li>
<li>The image is saved in the background in chat as linking to something
like
<code>https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/{some-encoding}/{link-to-original-image}</code></li>
<li>That replacement cache link is what is displayed to the user</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully, you can see where the issue is coming from here: step
5.</p>
<p>If the caching server retrieves the image on the user’s behalf, the
IP address that’s going to get displayed is the caching server’s IP and
not the target’s IP address and as a result killing the punchline 🫤</p>
<p>So, instead, we need to detect if a data centre is accessing our
image and if it is, give the data centre the bait to display instead as
this is what will be displayed to the user in Discord. And remember, as
a result of this, the end goal is to get the user to click “Open in
Browser” in Discord so that it will take them there and the browser will
access the server directly so we can lift the user’s actual IP
address.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-discord-like-this">Why is Discord like this?</h2>
<p>It’s anyone’s guess why Discord does it like this. However, we could
probably relate it to the Information Security CIA Triad:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://xsfs.xyz/assets/img/cia-triad.svg" alt="CIA Triad" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">CIA Triad</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Preventing people like me from
doing something like this easily as someone could easily collect a large
amount of real user IP addresses this way if there was no cache/proxy
and no one could stop us</li>
<li><strong>Integrity</strong>: make sure it doesn’t change - it’s the
same as when it was posted (although this doesn’t entirely line up as
the image is cached when it’s loaded on the client’s side and not when
the actor posts it, it also occasionally updates it’s cache too)</li>
<li><strong>Availability</strong>: Imagine the image linked to a small
server in someone’s attic and it got posted in a large server. The image
being posted there and many users accessing the image at once with
Discord open in the background could simply DDOS the host. Or simply,
the original endpoint’s server may have slow internet</li>
</ol>
<p>Probably some other reasons like:</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Scanning the image for malicious content (malware, content that is
against the TOS/Guidelines)</li>
<li>Reducing their bandwidth impact on the host (related to point
3)</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, nowadays it’s a lot harder to pull this off due to this
pop-up: <img src="https://xsfs.xyz/assets/img/2023/discord-warning.png"
alt="Discord showing a warning about the true URL of the image that was posted" /></p>
<p>Especially considering the URL where this ‘resource’ is stored, it’s
very on the nose and as a normal user seeing this you may think twice
about opening the image in the browser. I don’t know if companies have
been going this ‘zero trust’ route of external resources because of
genuine concern for user safety or because they are just trying to
mitigate user error (as it could be bad press if Discord doesn’t do
enough to protect its users from themselves). Either way, it’s good to
see this warning - imagine the havoc this could cause!</p>

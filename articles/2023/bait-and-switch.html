<p>But when we send this image into a Discord server, we get this:<br />

<p>Did you know? Web servers don’t have to serve static images, as long
as they return the data with a specified MIME type the browser will
render this. That means we can use simple web server frameworks, like
NodeJS + Express, to interpret a request; modify an image; and then
return the data the client is expecting.</p>

friends. Under no circumstances should this code be modified for
malicious intent.</p>
<h2 id="image-troll-server">Image Troll Server</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h3>
<p>A NodeJS http server that will capture a user’s IP and then present
it back to them. It is written in TypeScript for no particular reason
other than I was working on similar Express server code for another
project which I borrowed for this and didn’t feel like rewriting it in
JavaScript.</p>
<p>It’s also not very well written code. Not my best work, I must say,
but who creates the cleanest code for the lowest gag</p>
<h3 id="what-does-it-do">What does it do?</h3>
<p>Designed primarily for trolling on Discord, in it’s current state it
will display some (not very good) bait to get the user to click “Open in
Browser” and then display their IP address to them.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-we-need-to-use-bait">Why do we need to use bait?</h3>
<p>To understand why we need bait, we need to understand how Discord
handles images. Here is the basic process for how an image is displayed
to a user in Discord:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A user sends an image</li>
<li>A Discord crawler crawls the link to see what it is
(<code>crawl-{crawler-ip-address}.ptr.discord.com</code>)</li>
<li>The crawler sees that it’s an image, and hands off to the caching
server
(<code>{undetermined-ip-address}.bc.googleusercontent.com</code>)</li>
<li>The caching server reads the image</li>
<li>The image is saved in the background in chat as linking to something
like
<code>https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/{some-encoding}/{link-to-original-image}</code></li>
<li>That replacement cache link is what is actually displayed to the
user</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully you can see where the issue is coming in here: step 5.</p>
<p>If the caching server retrieves the image on the user’s behalf, the
IP address that’s going to get displayed is the caching server’s IP and
not the target’s IP address. This kills the punchline 🫤.</p>
<p>So, instead, we need to detect if a datacenter is caching our image
and if it is, give the datacenter the bait to display instead as this is
what will be displayed to the user in Discord. The end goal is to get
the user to click “Open in Browser” in Discord, so that it will take
them there and the browser will access the server directly so we can
lift the user’s actual IP address.</p>
<p>It’s anyone’s guess why Discord does it like this. However, we could
probably relate it back to the Information Security CIA Triad:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Confidentiality: Preventing people like me from doing something like
this easily as we could easily collect a large amount of IP addresses
this way if there was no cache and no one could really stop us</li>
<li>Integrity: make sure it doesn’t change - it’s the same as when it
was posted (although this doesn’t entirely line up as the image is
cached when it’s loaded on the clients side and not when the actor posts
it)</li>
<li>Availability: Imagine the image linked to a small server in
someone’s attic and it got posted in a large server. The image being
posted there and that many users accessing the image at once with
Discord open in the background could simply DDOS the host. Or simply,
the original endpoint’s server may have slow internet</li>
</ol>
<p>Probably some other reasons like:</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Scanning the image for malicious content (malware, content that is
against the TOS/Guidelines)</li>
<li>Reducing their bandwidith impact on the host (related to point
3)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="why-did-you-make-this-publish-this-code">Why did you make this /
publish this code?</h3>
<p>I just wanted to share this code so that others can have a bit of fun
trolling their friends, as well as learn how to capture IP addresses and
manipulate images in NodeJS if for some forsaken reason you want to do
that.</p>
<h3 id="advice-for-repurposing">Advice for repurposing</h3>
<p>If you are repurposing this mini project for another chat app, you’ll
first want to check if it also does any similar caching and place bait
in front of your targets instead. Then update the nslookup if you find a
consistent tell on if the client is a datacenter or an actual user - the
tell in this case was the IP’s host name contained
“<code>googleusercontent.com</code>”.</p>
<p>You’ll also want to host this on the Cloud unless you’ve already got
your own server that others can connect to and don’t mind potentially
compromising your IP address/domain as if someone takes the image and
reposts it somewhere else, there’s a exponential chance that someone
unsavoury might reverse what you did and try to come after your
server.</p>
<h3 id="running-the-server">Running the server</h3>
<p>Oh yeah, almost forgot about this.</p>
<p>The usual to run a Node server</p>
<p>Install the dependencies</p>
<pre><code>npm i</code></pre>
<p>Run the server</p>
<pre><code>npm start</code></pre>
<p>This starts a development server, btw, not a production one. It’ll
also auto update when you modify routes.ts. Just keep that in mind.</p>

Users</h1>

<p><span class="material-symbols-rounded">Science</span> Part of the
Experiment Write-Up series</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The following is a real image which is being retrieved from an
external server:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://troll.xsfs.xyz/troll.png" alt="Troll Image" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Troll Image</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Don‚Äôt believe that this is your real IP address? <a
href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/"
class="uri">https://whatismyipaddress.com/</a><br />
Of course, if you‚Äôre using a VPN, this won‚Äôt be your IP address but an
IP address belonging to the VPN</p>
<p>But when we send this image into a Discord server, we get this:<br />
<img src="https://xsfs.xyz/assets/img/2023/discord-bait.png"
alt="Discord Image" /></p>
<h2 id="how-does-this-work">How does this work?</h2>
<p>Well, you can read the code <a
href="https://github.com/the-wright-jamie/Image-Troll-Server">here</a>
and see for yourself, but the code doesn‚Äôt reveal the full story - so
keep reading to learn more about this.</p>
<p>Basically web servers don‚Äôt have to serve static images. As long as
they return the data with a specified MIME type the browser (or
application, i.e.¬†in this case Discord) will be able to render whatever
it was that was sent to it. That means we can use simple web server
frameworks, like NodeJS + Express, to interpret a request; modify an
image; and then return the data the client is expecting.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-intended-path-for-the-victim">What is the intended
path for the victim?</h2>
<p>Due to the way Discord works, we need to present some bait to the
user to get them to click to middle click the image (if they are viewing
this on desktop), or ‚ÄúOpen in browser‚Äù (if they on any other device).
This will redirect them to a new tab in their browser which will then
display their IP address to them (which you saw above).</p>
<p>So basically <code>User sees (bait) image</code> ‚ûú
<code>User opens in browser</code> ‚ûú <code>User gets pranked</code></p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-to-use-bait">Why do we need to use bait?</h2>
<p>You may be thinking the reason we need to use bait is to get around
moderators in servers immediately deleting the images, but actually,
it‚Äôs a little more complicated than that. TL;DR, Discord presents a
cached version of the image to the user.</p>
<p>The long answer: to understand why we need bait, we need to
understand how Discord handles images. Here is the basic process for how
an image is displayed to a user in Discord:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A user sends the link to the image</li>
<li>A Discord crawler crawls the link to see what it is
(<code>crawl-{crawler-ip-address}.ptr.discord.com</code>)</li>
<li>The crawler sees that it‚Äôs an image, and hands it off to the caching
server
(<code>{undetermined-ip-address}.bc.googleusercontent.com</code>)</li>
<li>The caching server reads the image</li>
<li>The image is saved in the background in chat as linking to something
like
<code>https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/{some-encoding}/{link-to-original-image}</code></li>
<li>That replacement cache image is what is displayed to the user</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully, you can see where the issue is coming from here - the
cached image is what‚Äôs displayed, not the original image.</p>
<p>If the caching server retrieves the image on the user‚Äôs behalf, the
IP address that‚Äôs going to get displayed is the caching server‚Äôs IP and
not the target‚Äôs IP address and as a result killing the punchline ü´§. In
a way, it would work for a brief moment - someone seeing it might get
freaked out until they actually check on Google what their IP address
is, but actually presenting the user‚Äôs IP address to them is a lot more
effective.</p>
<p>So, instead, we need to detect if a data centre is accessing our
image and if it is, give the data centre the bait to display instead as
this is what will be displayed to the user in Discord. And remember, the
end goal is to get the user to open the image in the browser so we can
lift the user‚Äôs actual IP address.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-discord-like-this">Why is Discord like this?</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess why Discord does it like this. However, we could
probably relate it to the Information Security CIA Triad:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Preventing people like me from
doing something like this easily as someone could easily collect a large
amount of real user IP addresses this way if there was no cache/proxy
and no one could stop us</li>
<li><strong>Integrity</strong>: make sure it doesn‚Äôt change - it‚Äôs the
same as when it was posted (although this doesn‚Äôt entirely line up as
the image is cached when it‚Äôs loaded on the client‚Äôs side and not when
the actor posts it, it also occasionally updates it‚Äôs cache too)</li>
<li><strong>Availability</strong>: Imagine the image linked to a small
server in someone‚Äôs attic and it got posted in a large server. The image
being posted there and many users accessing the image at once with
Discord open in the background could simply DDOS the host. Or simply,
the original endpoint‚Äôs server may have slow internet</li>
</ol>
<p>Probably some other reasons like:</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Scanning the image for malicious content (malware, content that is
against the TOS/Guidelines)</li>
<li>Reducing their bandwidth impact on the host (related to point
3)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, we have learnt how people are able to pull off these
kind of pranks. The process used by the server to figure out if a cache
server is accessing the image is somewhat rudimentary, but it works for
the purposes we are using here. It could be improved for other services,
for example GitHub uses a similar system - so if you wanted to use this
broadly, you‚Äôd have to change it to have a better detection of caching
servers. In reality, you‚Äôd have to know what websites a services use
cache in this way.</p>
<p>This was an interesting dip into how Discord handles images, and I
hope you were also able to learn something new from this article. I
encourage you to go out and explore for yourself, just don‚Äôt do
something that could get you in trouble!</p>
